towersMain is the file where the hanoi puzzle algorithm is used.
Requirement 2 completed by modifying main function to output certain commands depending on how many arguments were given. I have modified the code so it satisfies all given arguments. All outputs were achieved.


Lab 2 Questions:

Question 1

1) towers(5,2,3) will recursively call towers(4,2,1)

2) There will be 31 recursive calls to towers() before returning to the intial invocation

3) The 1st disk will move from tower 2 to tower 3

4) The 2nd recursive call will be: towers(3,2,3)

Question 2 

 The formula for determining the number of moves required to make in a hanoi puzzle is (2^n)-1, where n is the number of disks. Since we know n = 8, we can plug it in the formula to figure out the answer, which is 255.
