Everything compiled and worked. n-1 is number of times it is being compared
n is number of elements in arrray (n*(n-1))

Lab 3 Questions:

2a. insertionSort Analysis
Worst case: Swaps T(n) = n^2/2
            Copies T(n) = n^2/2
            Compares T(n) = n^2/2
Best case: Swaps T(n) = 0
           Copies T(n) = n
           Compares T(n) =  n-1
Average case: Swaps: T(n) = n^2/4
              Copies: T(n) = n^2/4
              Compares: T(n) = n^2/4

2b. mergeSort Analysis
Worst case: Swaps T(n) = 0
           Copies T(n) = nlog(n)
           Compares T(n) = nlog(n)
Best case: Swaps T(n) = 0
           Copies T(n) = nlog(n)
           Compares T(n) = nlog(n)
Average case: Swaps T(n) = 0
           Copies T(n) = nlog(n)
           Compares T(n) = nlog(n)
